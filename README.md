# Multiscale-Landslide-Detection-Using-Remote-Sensing-Imagery

This research focuses on developing a deep learning-based system for landslide detection using satellite and remote sensing imagery. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the study classifies terrains into "landslide" and "non-landslide" categories. A comprehensive dataset is prepared through various sources like satellite images, UAV data, and field surveys, with preprocessing techniques such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and noise reduction enhancing model accuracy.

The research highlights the effectiveness of CNNs in detecting landslide-prone areas, validated through key performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score. The approach aims to improve real-time monitoring and support disaster mitigation efforts, offering valuable insights to geologists and disaster management authorities.
